## Welcome

I'm currently completing my final semester as an astrophysics undergrad at the University of Toronto.
On the astro side I'm looking into what stellar feedback effects are dominant in star cluster formation simulations with different initial conditions.
On the physics side, I've been using the Inspect AI framework and a subset of MMLU physics problems to probe the open-ended reasoning ability of LLM models.
At a high level, I'm also learning how to learn better. I hope to contribute to AI Safety in some capacity and I'm trying to narrow down how I may best do that.

Training for long-distance triathlons is my other main activity and I'd be interested in connecting with people who want to talk about this, learning in general, or AI Safety!
