## Welcome

I'm currently completing my final semester as an astrophysics undergrad at the University of Toronto.
On the astro side I'm looking into what stellar feedback effects are dominant in star cluster formation simulations with different initial conditions.
On the physics side, I'm currently creating solutions for a subset of MMLU physics problems, which I will use to evaluate LLM reasoning ability.
Overall, I'm trying to learn how to learn better. I hope to apply what I learn to contribute to AI Safety in some capacity that has not yet been determined.
